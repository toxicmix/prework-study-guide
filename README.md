# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

this is a webpage that shows the user what was made in the prework section of the coding bootcamp

i did thi because i want to be properly prepared for the corse when it starts

i built this project because i wanted to learn about the languages that will be used in the bootcamp and learn how to operate the tools used when coding

this solves the problem of not knowing what or how im doingwhen i enter the full program

i learned how to use the command line to "modify" files and upload projects to gitub
